# Power Face Recognition SDK (PowerSDK)

**PowerSDK** is a standalone facial recognition SDK for Android that performs **on-device face matching** and returns the **nickname** of detected individuals from a local face database.

The SDK is fully self-contained and operates **without an internet connection** or developer account — however, it is **read-only**. You can recognize known faces but **cannot register new faces** into the database without a cloud integration via `dev.secureid.ro`.

## ⚙️ What PowerSDK Does

- Detects and recognizes faces from the camera preview
- Matches against a preloaded `.dat` face database
- Returns the **nickname** of each recognized individual
- Works completely **offline** (for read-only usage)

## 📥 Face Database Requirement

Before using PowerSDK, download the face database file:

📦 Romanian market database: https://powerpaysecure.net/devices/1-facedist.dat
For use in other countries, contact us to receive a region-specific `.dat` file.  
> This file is required to enable recognition of known users.

## 🔐 Developer Account (Optional)

You **do not need an account** to use the SDK for offline recognition.  
However, to:
- Register new faces
- Manage face identities
- Synchronize cloud-linked templates

You’ll need a developer account at:
https://dev.secureid.ro
