# Power Face Recognition SDK (PowerSDK)

**PowerSDK** is a standalone facial recognition SDK for Android that performs **on-device face matching** and returns the **nickname** of detected individuals from a local face database.

The SDK is fully self-contained and operates **without an internet connection** or developer account ‚Äî however, it is **read-only**. You can recognize known faces but **cannot register new faces** into the database without a cloud integration via `dev.secureid.ro`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What PowerSDK Does

- Detects and recognizes faces from the camera preview
- Matches against a preloaded `.dat` face database
- Returns the **nickname** of each recognized individual
- Works completely **offline** (for read-only usage)

---

## üì• Face Database Requirement

Before using PowerSDK, download the face database file:

üì¶ Romanian market database: https://powerpaysecure.net/devices/1-facedist.dat
For use in other countries, contact us to receive a region-specific `.dat` file.  
> This file is required to enable recognition of known users.

---

## üîê Developer Account (Optional)

You **do not need an account** to use the SDK for offline recognition.  
However, to:
- Register new faces
- Manage face identities
- Synchronize cloud-linked templates

You‚Äôll need a developer account at:
https://dev.secureid.ro

## üì≤ Integration Guide
Download PowerSDK-release.aar file form our webpage: https://www.power-dynamic.ro/sdk/PowerSDK-release.aar (153mb)

Place the SDK in your project:
<your_project>/app/libs/PowerSDK-release.aar

### 2. Configure Gradle

#### In `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        flatDir {
            dirs("app/libs")
        }
    }
}

In app/build.gradle.kts:

dependencies {
    implementation(name = "PowerSDK-release", ext = "aar")
}

3. Required Permissions
Add these to your AndroidManifest.xml:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

4. Initialize the SDK
boolean success = PowerSDK.initialize(this);
if (!success) {
    // Handle failure: likely due to missing license or .dat file
    finish();
}
